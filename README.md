## All bbPress localize files and instructions in one place

Since many tutorials about translating bbPress are out of date, people're getting stucked in this simple task -- get the damn forum localized! I hope this project could be a place where there always has the right instructions and all locale files.


## Installation
Put .mo and .po files in /wp-content/languages/plugins. bbPress would automatically pick the right one based on locale setting in wp-config.php.
